## Project 1
Calculate Amortization, APR(annual percentage rate) and format them in a nicer and readable way from the given csv file about loan\

## Project 2
### Rules
1. Initialize a 10x10 gridlines and randomly generate barrier in the path of the moving object.\
2. The object will move one grid to the direction that the user clicks(namely, right, left, up, down).\
3. Each time the object moves past a grid, the socre will be updated with +1. Each time the object moves past a barrier, the socre will be updated with +5.\
### Functions:
1. Display a panel containing previous top 4 scores, player names,and different functional buttons.\
2. Display different contents as the user clicks different buttons. If the user wants to play, it will display grids(game panels) where user can click to move the object.\
3. When the object hits the target area, the programme will calculate the score and display it in the beginning panel if it is among the new top 4 scores.\
4. Get the top 4 game player's names and their scores after they move the object to a target area.\
5. Update the panel containing top 4 scores, player names,and different functional buttons.\

## Project 3: 
Add diagnal movement function on the basis of project 2. Also, sleep for a given time period defined by user and display colorful alternating background when the crafter successfully reaches the end within specific time periods.
