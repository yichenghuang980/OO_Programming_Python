## Project 2
### Rules
1. Initialize a 10x10 gridlines and randomly generate barrier in the path of the moving object.
2. The object will move one grid to the direction that the user clicks(namely, right, left, up, down).
3. Each time the object moves past a grid, the score will be updated with +1. Each time the object moves past a barrier, the score will be updated with +5.
### General
![gameStart](https://github.com/yichenghuang980/OO_Programming_Python/blob/master/screenshots/pj2_start.png)

1. Display a panel containing previous top 4 scores, player names, and different functional buttons.
2. Display corresponding contents as the user clicks different buttons. If the user wants to play, it will display grids(game panels) where user can click to move the object.
3. When the object hits the target area, the program will calculate the score and display it in the beginning panel if it beats one of the existing top 4 scores.
4. Get the top 4 game player's names and their scores after they move the object to a target area.
5. Update the panel containing top 4 scores, player names, and different functional buttons.

## Project 3

### Improvements
1. Add diagonal movement function on the basis of project 2.
2. Sleep for a given time period defined by user.
3. Display colorful alternating background when the object successfully reaches the target area within specific time periods.
### General
This program is a game where the user has to complete a maze in the least amount of moves by avoiding tripwires. It keeps track of players names, moves, and scores. At last, the home screen displays the top scores and enables the user to start new games while the field window is used for game play.
