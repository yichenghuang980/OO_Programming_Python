Project 1:\
Calculate Amortization, APR(annual percentage rate) and format them in a nicer and readable way from the given csv file about loan\
Project 2:\
Initialize a 10x10 gridlines and randomly generate barrier in the path of the moving object. The object will move one grid to the direction that the user clicks(namely, right, left, up, down). Each time the object moves past a grid, the socre will be updated with +1. Each time the object moves past a barrier, the socre will be updated with +5.\
This program is to get the top 4 game player's names and their scores after they move the object to a target area. It will first displays a window containing previous top 4 scores, player names,and different functional buttons. Then it will display different contents as the user clicks different buttons. If the user wants to play, it will display grids where user can click in the same column or row to make the object move. When the object hits the target area, the programme will calculate the score he gets and display it in the beginning window if it is among the new top 4 scores.\

Project 3: Add diagnal movement function on the basis of project 2. Also, sleep for a given time period defined by user and display colorful alternating background when the crafter successfully reaches the end within specific time periods.
